# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Leveraging historical stock data fetched from the Yahoo Finance API, I conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling. The LSTM model was trained to predict future stock prices based on past trends, achieving an RMSE of 11. To make the model interactive, I deployed it using Streamlit, allowing the user to enter stock symbols and see real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras, Yahoo Finance API, Streamlit
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit

## Results
- Model Performance: The LSTM model achieved an RMSE of 11 on the test dataset.
- Visualization: Predicted vs. actual stock prices were visualized to assess the model's accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
- Extend the app functionality to predict multiple stocks simultaneously.
